## Rendering

### Concepts

#### 3D Space

Let's start from a [2D content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Tutorial/Adding_2D_content_to_a_WebGL_context) first.

The first example in rendering section is to draw a simple *square untextured plane*. As the words in italic style says, it is **a plane with the shape of square and wihout any textures**.

Note that, even though we are gonna draw a 2D content(the square plane), we are still doing this in the 3D drawing context(3D space) created in last steps.

That is:
> we're putting it directly **in front of the camera** perpendicular to the **view direction**.
